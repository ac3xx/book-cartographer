# Character Interaction Counts Fix

## Problem Overview

The high-priority issue with missing character interaction counts has been resolved. Previously, all relationship edges had interaction_count = 0, leading to inaccurate centrality calculations where characters in a clique (like Carl, Donut, and Bea) would all have identical centrality scores regardless of their actual importance in the story.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Improved Relationship Extraction Prompt

Modified `prompts.py` to explicitly request interaction metrics from the LLM:

- Added a dedicated "INTERACTION METRICS" section in the prompt
- Included specific instructions to count and estimate interaction frequency
- Added critical requirements to never leave interaction counts as zero
- Provided guidance on expected interaction counts for different relationship strengths

### 2. Character Co-occurrence Detection

Added a new method in `llm_processor.py` that analyzes character mentions in text excerpts:

- Counts when two character names appear in the same excerpt
- Creates a co-occurrence matrix for all character pairs
- Uses this data as a fallback for interaction counts
- Adjusts co-occurrence values based on relationship strength

### 3. Fallback and Estimation Logic

Enhanced the relationship processing with multiple fallback mechanisms:

- First tries to use LLM-provided interaction counts
- Falls back to co-occurrence data if available
- Uses relationship strength to estimate interaction counts as a last resort
- Ensures all relationships have non-zero interaction_count and mention_together_count
- Populates character.metrics.interaction_counts with data from all observed interactions

### 4. Fixed Pydantic Deprecation Issues

Updated Pydantic model serialization across the codebase:

- Replaced `.dict()` with `.model_dump()` in character_graph.py
- Added compatibility layer in llm_processor.py to support both Pydantic v1 and v2
- Ensures code is forward-compatible with Pydantic v2

## Expected Results

With these changes, the character graph will now have:

1. Weighted relationships based on actual character interactions
2. More accurate centrality calculations that differentiate major characters
3. Better "importance_score" values that reflect true character importance
4. More realistic character type classification based on interaction patterns

## Testing

The fix can be tested on any existing character graph by:

1. Processing a new EPUB file with the updated code
2. Examining relationship metrics in the resulting JSON file
3. Checking that characters have different centrality scores
4. Verifying that major characters have higher importance scores

For existing graph files, the `recalculate_centrality.py` script can be used to update centrality scores based on the new interaction data.
