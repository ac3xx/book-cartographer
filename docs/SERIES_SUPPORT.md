# Series Support Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Model Changes

### Update CharacterGraph Class
- Add series metadata fields (series name, book number, total books)
- Update constructor to include series information
- Modify save/load methods to handle series data

### Create SeriesGraph Class
- Define a container for multiple CharacterGraph instances
- Implement methods to combine character data across books
- Track character evolution across the series

## 2. Configuration Updates

### Extend AppConfig
- Add series configuration section
- Include fields for:
  - Series tracking toggle
  - Series name override
  - Character alignment thresholds
  - Evolution tracking parameters
  - Cross-book reference options

## 3. CLI Enhancements

### Add Series Commands
- `series-init`: Create a new series tracking file
- `series-add`: Process a book and add to existing series
- `series-analyze`: Generate comprehensive series analysis
- `series-report`: Create character evolution reports

### Update Process Command
- Add series-related flags:
  - `--series-name`: Specify series name
  - `--book-number`: Position in series
  - `--add-to-series`: Add to existing series tracking

## 4. Character Reconciliation

### Implement Name Resolution
- Match characters across books with different name forms
- Create algorithm to resolve character identities
- Handle aliases, nicknames, and title changes

### Character Evolution Tracking
- Track character changes between books
- Identify growth, relationship shifts, and role changes
- Generate character arc visualizations

## 5. Processing Pipeline Updates

### Multi-Book Processing
- Enable batch processing of all books in a series
- Optimize for shared character information
- Implement incremental processing for new additions

### Series-Wide Analysis
- Create relationships between books
- Identify recurring themes, locations, and plot elements
- Generate timeline of events across series

## 6. Output Enhancements

### Series-Aware Outputs
- Update image prompt generator to include series evolution
- Enhance KODict output with cross-book references
- Create new series-specific outputs:
  - Character timelines
  - Relationship evolution maps
  - Series concordance

## 7. Storage & Persistence

### Series Data Storage
- Define series metadata file format
- Implement saving/loading of combined series data
- Create versioning system for series data updates

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Data Model
1. Update CharacterGraph with series fields
2. Create SeriesGraph container class
3. Implement basic character matching algorithm
4. Update config and CLI for series parameters

### Phase 2: Processing Pipeline
1. Enhance character extraction to consider series context
2. Implement cross-book character resolution
3. Add evolution tracking between books
4. Create series-wide metrics and analysis

### Phase 3: Outputs & Visualization
1. Update existing generators for series awareness
2. Add series-specific output modes
3. Implement character evolution visualization
4. Create comprehensive series reports

## 9. Testing Strategy

1. Create test series data with known character overlaps
2. Validate character matching across books
3. Test evolution tracking with progressive character changes
4. Verify metrics calculation for series-wide importance

## 10. Documentation Updates

1. Add series processing guide to README
2. Document new CLI commands
3. Create examples of series analysis outputs
4. Add configuration reference for series parameters
